# Source code

Although `epiworld` is a header-only C++ library, we do make use of other
cool projects in some of the examples and for testing. The
[`cxxopts`](https://github.com/jarro2783/cxxopts) library provides a smooth
interface for using options in your C++ program.
[`catch2`](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2) is a great C++ unit-tests
framework that we have use in [other projects](https://github.com/USCbiostats/barry).

Although you are free to use `epiworld/`, we also have a single-header
version that incorporates all its components [here](../epiworld.hpp).
